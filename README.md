Web interface for raspberry administration

This web interface is written fully in python, you do not need to install another web server (like apache or lighttpd).
By default, there is only 2 modules, status which show you information about your raspberry and gpio to control your gpio ports.

You can add your own module very easily, all the instructions are in the createmodule text file.
